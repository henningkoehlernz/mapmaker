Requirements: 
------------ 

To run MapMaker, you will need the java runtime environment (jre) v1.7 or newer, which can be downloaded at http://java.sun.com for most platforms.


Installation: 
------------ 

If you read this, you should have extracted the following files:

MapMaker.jar - the main program
readme.txt - this file
gpl-3.0.txt - liscence description
makefile - for rebuilding mapmaker from src
doc - documentation
maps - sample maps
src - cource code

To run MapMaker, you should be in the install directory (whereever the files above are on your machine).
If you are not, MapMaker will not display any help, though all else should function properly.
Now to execute MapMaker, all it takes is

> java -jar MapMaker.jar

Potentially double-clicking on MapMaker.jar should work as well.
